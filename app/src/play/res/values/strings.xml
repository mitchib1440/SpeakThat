    <string name="play_donate_badge_placeholder">Hi! My name is Mitchi and SpeakThat is a passion project of mine. I originally created it for my own use, and released it under an open source license. As more people have been using it lately, I\'m spending a lot of time maintaining it and answering support emails. If you can help me in any way, I\'d greatly appreciate it!</string>
