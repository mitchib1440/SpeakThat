The app picker introduced in version 1.6.3 now includes the option to add your own package names, even if they aren't installed or detected. Ticker text is now supported in the Custom Speech Format section. "Trigger" has been renamed to "Condition" for Conditional Rules, as this makes more sense and isn't a blatant lie. My apologies to everyone who got confused by that last one!
