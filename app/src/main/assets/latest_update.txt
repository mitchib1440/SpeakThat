SpeakThat! v1.7.1 is a hotfix for a theming issue in v1.7.0. The following changelogs are from 1.7.0 as they are still very much relevant!      ◉ IMPORTANT: Conditional Rules has been overhauled massively. If you have any rules set up, you should check them to ensure they still work. While you're there, you can now add a variety of other conditions and actions. These give you much greater control over your notification readouts. The new Conditions include:    ◉ Battery Percentage    ◉ Charging Status    ◉ Notification Contains    ◉ Notification From    ◉ Foreground App (Accessibility Permission required)    ◉ Device Unlocked    ◉ Screen Orientation       ◉ The new Actions include:    ◉ Apply Custom Speech Format    ◉ Force Private    ◉ Override Private       ◉ Conditional Rules can now be fully exported and imported along with or separately to the global settings configurations.       ◉ In the Filter Settings, you can now find the option to remove emojis, which makes for much cleaner speech output.       ◉ Additionally, bugs related to Content Cap have been fixed. Speech should now end correctly, with queues continuing and music being resumed. Thanks for the bug reports that helped me diagnose these!       ◉ Wave to Stop has been updated, adding a new "Wave Hold Time" slider. This lets you decide how long the proximity sensor must be covered to cancel a readout.       ◉ URL Handling now handles bare links (any that don't start with "https" or "www").       ◉ SpeakThat's notification channel now defaults to low priority.       ◉ A compatibility patch has been added for older TTS engines.       ◉ Adaptive Icon support has been added.       ◉ Minor UI and spelling improvements.
