Several bugs have been fixed, including but not limited to the language change dialog showing up on app launch, the auto-updater not actively checking for updates on the GitHub edition, the Battery Optimization Exemption request not firing as it should, and the app logging preferences being reset when the app is restarted. WiFi rules have been made more robust on newer versions of Android, the app picker is now a full-screen UI allowing you to scroll through an entire list of apps rather than having to search for them, and the SpeakThat Latest section you are currently reading has been added! (How very meta!) Also for you Google Play users, I've replaced the external donation links with Google Payments instead, as I want to remain in compliance with Google's terms of service. If you have donated through the Play Store, you are able to change the colour of the SpeakThat logo on the home page. But don't worry, SpeakThat will remain ENTIRELY free and open source. No functionality will ever be paywalled. Also, happy new year!
