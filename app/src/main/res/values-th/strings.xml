    <string name="notification_behavior_dialog_title">Notification Behavior Options</string>
    <string name="notification_behavior_dialog_message">Choose how SpeakThat handles multiple notifications:

<b>ðŸ”„ Interrupt</b> - Stops current notification and reads new one immediately. Best for urgent notifications.

<b>ðŸ“‹ Queue</b> - Finishes current notification, then reads new ones in order. Nothing gets missed.

<b>â­ï¸ Skip</b> - Ignores new notifications while reading. Simple but you might miss important ones.

<b>ðŸ§  Smart (Recommended)</b> - Priority apps interrupt, others queue. Perfect balance of urgency and completeness.

Smart mode lets you choose which apps are urgent enough to interrupt (like calls, messages) while other apps wait their turn.</string>
    <string name="custom_app_names_title">Custom App Names</string>
    <string name="custom_app_names_description">Customize how app names are spoken in notifications</string>
    <string name="add_custom_app_name">Add Custom App Name</string>

    <string name="custom_name_hint">Custom name (e.g., Twitter)</string>
    <string name="custom_app_names_example">Example: X app reads as Twitter</string>
    <string name="media_behavior_dialog_title">Media Behavior Options</string>
    <string name="media_behavior_dialog_message">Choose how SpeakThat handles notifications while music/videos play:

<b>ðŸŽµ Ignore</b> - Speaks over your media. Simple but can be disruptive.

<b>â¸ï¸ Pause</b> - Pauses media completely while speaking. Good for podcasts, but interrupts music flow.

<b>ðŸ”‰ Lower Audio (Recommended)</b> - Temporarily reduces media volume so you can hear both. Most natural experience.

<b>Silence</b> - Doesn\'t speak while media plays. Quiet but you might miss important notifications.

Lower Audio works like a car radio - it ducks the music down when speaking, then brings it back up. Perfect for music lovers who still want notifications.</string>
    <string name="shake_to_stop_dialog_title">Shake to Stop Feature</string>
    <string name="shake_to_stop_dialog_message">Shake to Stop lets you instantly silence SpeakThat by shaking your device:

<b>âœ¨ Why it\'s helpful:</b>
â€¢ Stop embarrassing notifications in quiet places
â€¢ Quick control when your hands are busy
â€¢ Works even when screen is off
â€¢ No fumbling for buttons

<b>ðŸŽ¯ How it works:</b>
â€¢ Shake your device firmly (like a dice shake)
â€¢ Current notification stops immediately
â€¢ Queued notifications are cleared
â€¢ New notifications work normally

<b>âš™ï¸ Customization:</b>
â€¢ Adjust sensitivity for your preference
â€¢ Test your shake strength with the meter

<b>âœ¨ Why it\'s helpful:</b>
â€¢ Perfect for users who can\'t shake their device
â€¢ Great for phones on desks or mounts
â€¢ Works with one hand
â€¢ No physical device movement needed
â€¢ Accessibility-friendly alternative to shake

<b>ðŸŽ¯ How it works:</b>
â€¢ Wave your hand in front of the device (like a magic gesture)
â€¢ Uses the proximity sensor to detect hand movement
â€¢ Current notification stops immediately
â€¢ Queued notifications are cleared
â€¢ New notifications work normally

<b>âš™ï¸ Customization:</b>
â€¢ Adjust sensitivity for your preference
â€¢ Test your wave detection with the meter
â€¢ Works great for different hand sizes and distances

This feature is especially useful for accessibility, desk users, and anyone who prefers gesture control over physical movement.</string>
