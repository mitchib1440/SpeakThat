    <string name="notification_behavior_dialog_message">Choose how SpeakThat handles multiple notifications:

<b>🔄 Interrupt</b> - Stops current notification and reads new one immediately. Best for urgent notifications.

<b>📋 Queue</b> - Finishes current notification, then reads new ones in order. Nothing gets missed.

<b>⏭️ Skip</b> - Ignores new notifications while reading. Simple but you might miss important ones.

<b>🧠 Smart (Recommended)</b> - Priority apps interrupt, others queue. Perfect balance of urgency and completeness.

Smart mode lets you choose which apps are urgent enough to interrupt (like calls, messages) while other apps wait their turn.</string>
    
    <string name="media_behavior_dialog_title">Media Behavior Options</string>
    <string name="media_behavior_dialog_message">Choose how SpeakThat handles notifications while music/videos play:

<b>🎵 Ignore</b> - Speaks over your media. Simple but can be disruptive.

<b>⏸️ Pause</b> - Pauses media completely while speaking. Good for podcasts, but interrupts music flow.

<b>🔉 Lower Audio (Recommended)</b> - Temporarily reduces media volume so you can hear both. Most natural experience.

<b>🔇 Silence</b> - Doesn\'t speak while media plays. Quiet but you might miss important notifications.

Lower Audio works like a car radio - it ducks the music down when speaking, then brings it back up. Perfect for music lovers who still want notifications.</string>
