<p><b>Voice notifications done right.</b></p>

<p>
SpeakThat! is an Android app that reads your incoming notifications out loud using
text-to-speech. Unlike most alternatives, SpeakThat! puts <em>you</em> fully in control
of what gets read, when it gets read, how it sounds, and when it stays completely silent.
</p>

<p>
No ads. No subscriptions. No tracking. Just speech.
</p>

<p><b>Why SpeakThat!?</b></p>

<ul>

<p>
SpeakThat! never sends your data anywhere unless <em>you</em> explicitly choose to submit
a bug report - and even then, it’s optional. What happens on your phone stays on your phone.
</p>

<p>
Ideal for accessibility, drivers and commuters, desk setups, athletes, parents, busy professionals,
and anyone who wants a healthier relationship with notifications.
</p>

<p><b>Actively developed</b></p>

<p>
SpeakThat! is continuously improved based on real user feedback. It’s built by someone
who genuinely uses it every day - which means features exist because they’re useful,
not because they look good in a marketing screenshot.
